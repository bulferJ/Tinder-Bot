# Tinder-Bot

This is a personal program I am writing which will automate certain repetitive tasks involved in my online dating life, most importantly swiping. I only swipe right. In fact, I so frequently swipe left I often find myself watching TV, or listening to a professor in class as I am monotonously scrolling my thumb in the same pattern for minutes at a time. Call me indecent, but it's all a numbers game for a pimp such as myself.

Now, back to the subject matter. Online dating requires repeating many tasks, such as swiping, sending openers which have a proven success rate that will be repeated. For a programmer such as myself, I will automate these tasks using a selenium web bot. 

I will likely disclose the current program publicly by the end of this month. Stay tuned.

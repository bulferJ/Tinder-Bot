# Tinder-Bot

This is a personal program I am writing which will automate certain repetitive tasks involved in my online dating life, most importantly swiping. I only swipe right. In fact, I so frequently swipe right I often find myself watching TV, or listening to a professor in class as I monotonously scroll my thumb in the same pattern for minutes at a time. 

Online dating requires repeating many tasks, such as swiping, sending the same messages, such as introducing yourself that will be repeated. For a programmer such as myself, I will automate these tasks using a selenium web bot. 

I will likely declassify the current code base publicly by the end of this month. Stay tuned.
